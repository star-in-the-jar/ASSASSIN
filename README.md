Artificial Intelligence Solution for Systematic Analysis of Serum Statistics and Intelligent Notifications.

## System description

ASSASSIN is a new secure and centralized system for sharing medical test results with patients and medical staff.
As opposed to different competing systems, ASSASSIN implements the newest security techniques and aims to revolutionize the field of medical IT systems.
In order to ensure maximum privacy and security each patient is issued a new account in the system, accessed via an anonymous login and further secured via 2FA.
Then using that account each patient is able to see their tests results remotely, or physically on the premises of the medical facility.
Apart from patients, each of the medical personnel is also issued an account in the system, secured identically to the patient accounts.
In order to ensure the medical personnel of the facility can do their jobs with utmost efficiency the medical personnel can also see the test results from their account
